The problem is caused because DX is not cleared before a division. The
error occurs at address 0040:0044 with a DIV CX instruction, where AX is 
fff9, CX is 0003, and DX is FFFF. Because DX is not cleared, when fff9
is divided by 0003, there is overflow, and this calls the illegal
event handler. This can be fixed by clearing DX.
