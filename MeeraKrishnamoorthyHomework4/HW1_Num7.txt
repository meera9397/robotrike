A) Is the event handler being called?
Yes, the event handler is being called because the Interrupt Request Register is 1, meaning
a timer interrupt has been requested. 

B) Is the timer running? 
Yes, the timer is running. The timer control register 2 has its enable bit set,
which indicates that the timer is in use. 

C) Is the timer generating interrupts?
Yes, the timer is generating interrupts because Timer 2 has its
interrupt bit set (which is set to generate an interrupt request when the Count  
register equals a Maximum Count register.)

D) Is the processor responding to interrupts in general (are they enabled)?
No, the processor is not responding to interrupt requests, because the interrupt
mask and the priority mask register is set so that timer interrupts are not
responded to. 
 

E) By now you should realize what the bug is in the code. Explain how to fix the bug 
   and then fix it in the debugger (don't change the code) and continue running the 
   program. What do you observe?

The bug is that the interrupt mask registers isset so that 
timer interrupts are not responded to. In order to change this, we must clear the interrupt mask register so that the timer interrupt can be responded to (write 0 to ff28h).
Once this is done, something is printed to the dipslay: U 6oL IC
